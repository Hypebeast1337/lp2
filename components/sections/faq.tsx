              <AccordionTrigger>How do the room QR codes work?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Each room receives a unique, time-bound QR at check-in. Guests scan to open a browser-based portal personalized to their room and languageâ€”no app or signup required.

              <AccordionContent>
                Yes. HotelSuite is multi-tenant with strict data isolation per hotel. You can manage single properties or large portfolios from one account.

              <AccordionContent>
                No registration is required for guests. They get instant access by scanning the room QR and can place orders or requests right away.

              <AccordionContent>
                We price per room with discounts at scale and annual billing options. This aligns costs with occupancy and delivers ROI in months through efficiency and upsell revenue.
